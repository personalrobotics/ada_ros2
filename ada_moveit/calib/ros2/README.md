**Note**: This calibration is calling `ros2` because it was done using ROS2's MoveIt2 Hand-Eye Calibration Pipeline ([Github](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/moveit2_calibration/tree/ros2_port), [Documentation](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/examples/hand_eye_calibration/hand_eye_calibration_tutorial.html)). Most likely, `default` will have better calibration parameters. However, these joint states and samples are included in case someone wants to expand upon them (e.g., add new joint states or samples) to achieve a better calibration.
